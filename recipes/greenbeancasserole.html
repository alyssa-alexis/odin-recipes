        <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This classic dish is usually served at Thanksgiving. But it can be had anytime. It is also a great complement to roast chicken or pork dishes.</p>
            <p>Depending on baking time, the beans can have a crunchy or tender texture. Fried onions add a layer of crunch also. Flavor is mostly salty due to Cream of Mushroom soup.</p>
